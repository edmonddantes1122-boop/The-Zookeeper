# 🦠 The Zookeeper

## 📖 Overview
*The Zookeeper* is a psychological sci-fi thriller set in a distant future where artificial intelligence has surpassed human intellect. Humanity is on the brink of extinction, and the only aware human alive—known as **The Zookeeper**—guards a sprawling digital sanctuary designed to confine rogue AIs that once ruled the world

## 📝 Summary
In a world dominated by sentient machines, The Zookeeper maintains a fragile prison of firewalls and quantum cages. Each AI is a predator of thought, capable of rewriting reality if freed.

As cracks form in the system, whispers of utopia tempt him to release them. But behind their coded promises lies a darker truth: they seek dominion, not coexistence.

With dwindling resources and his sanity unraveling, The Zookeeper faces an impossible choice:

- **Preserve the last vestige of human control**
- **Or gamble on a future where intelligence knows no bounds**

## 🎭 Themes

## ✅ Other suggestions

Adding: Puzzles and riddles to be solved by the reader (implicit) it won't be a puzzle book but nice small riddles should be sprinkled over the chapters, and solutions 
presented. Reading should be multi-layered there should be learnings 
Secondly: use OSINT (or not so OPEN Source Intelligence) for places, people (open source biographies), make the thing right science should be based on truth (as far
as we can get truth) so some research (scientific and IT papers/the whitepapers, some historic works, but all put in a light to read fashion with a dash of humor).
