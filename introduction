During his medical studies (to become anesthesiologist) he continued to visit (Zoos) and even work at the Zoo.

Richard is also technically inclined, serving as the go-to person for medical devices and conducting research into what the possibilities are of AI usage in the medical field.

[Richard heads the research of AI at his hospital - he is the main character, the Zookeeper, the one holding AI at bay, at the same time working in the very field that is so potentially disruptive.

His girlfriend: Melinda (based on Merilynn Vos Savant, who i real life is married to a medical inventor) 
Melinda plays an essential supportive role 



Then there is the antagonist: Head of an AI company only interested in power - 
has to be worked out yet, as good villain.

And of course the AI - AGI [the force, thinking force that can be used for harm or for good, or even..not used at all but autonomous]
